# MyFirstMicrogame

Description: This microgame is a sci-fi-themed first-person shooter where the player must eliminate all enemies to win. I customized the map by adding palm trees, futuristic barriers, enemy placements, and a unique weapon design. The skybox was changed to give a reddish, alien planet vibe. The mission objective is displayed clearly: Eliminate All the Enemies.

Reflection: Working on this microgame taught me a lot about how to use Unity and what goes into making a video game. I learned how to design a level by placing objects like trees, walls, and enemies to make the game more fun and challenging. One of my favorite parts was testing the gun and seeing how the enemies reacted when I shot at them. It was cool to see everything come together and work. I also learned how to set up the goal of the game, which was to defeat all the enemies. Some parts were hard, like making sure the enemies stayed in the right spots and did not glitch through walls. Another challenge was figuring out how to finish the game once all enemies were gone, but I kept trying and solved it. Overall, I had fun building this game and learning new skills.
